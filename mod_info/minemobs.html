    <p>Changes from original: 
        <strong>
            - Reduced model/texture quality<br>
            - Iron golem and wither features are changed with iron_golem_hammer and wither_heads<br>
            - The ender dragon doesn't drop the blocked ender dragon item but dragon pieces, used as for the other mobs<br>
            - The blocked mobs are not entities, but blocks (suggest to break from the centre of the block, life for the creeper and villager it is the feet, for the enderman it's the top part of the legs etc for a best appearance of the breaking)
